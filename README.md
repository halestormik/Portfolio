**Hello!** My name is _Bogdan_, I'm 32 years old, and I'm **very** interested in studying the course "QA engineer from beginning to middle" on Netology.ru

But _nevertheless_ it's not the end of my studying path. I want to learn who is the **DevOps** engineer, what is his knowledge, skills and what kind of work does he do. After _this_ course I plan to study for _that_ specialty.

**So wish me a good luck!**
